 * uses zlib. The optional compression level must be a value from 0 to 9
 * (inclusive). The lower the compression level value, the larger the

 * @param pIn Input buffer containing the data to be compressed.
 * @param pOut Output buffer to store the compressed data.

 * @param outSize Size of output buffer the compressed data will be written to.
 * @param compressionLevel Compression level to use. The compression level is
 * a value between 0 and 9. 0 indicates no compression and 9 indicates maximum
 * compression. A value of -1 will use Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION.
 * @returns Positive numbers indicate how many bytes of data have been written
 * to the output buffer; negative numbers indicate an error. The errors are:
 * @retval -1 Invalid arguments
 * @retval -2 Initialization error
 * @retval -3 Decompression error
