/**
 * Represents an encrypted network connection. This connection will perform a
 * Diffie-Hellman key exchange to negotiate a shared private. This shared
 * private will then be used as a Blowfish key to encrypt all other packets.
 *
 * @section encryptseq Encryption Sequence
 *
 * Encryption is initiated by the client sending an 8 byte magic sequence to
 * the server. On receipt of this magic sequence the server will reply with a
 * Diffie-Hellman base, prime, and server public. This packet starts with 4
 * bytes of 0 value followed by hex encoded strings of the base, prime, and
 * server public (in that order). Each string begins with a 32-bit big endian
 * value indicating the size of the string followed by the string data. There
 * is no padding or zero byte on these strings.
 *
 * When the client receives this packet from the server it will perform two
 * tasks. First, it will generate a random number to use as the client private.
 * This client private will be combined with the base and prime using the DH
 * algorithm to generate the client public. This client public is sent to the
 * server. This packet consists of just the client public in a hex encoded
 * string using the same string format described above. Second, the client
 * will use the server public in addition to the base, prime, and client
 * private with the DH algorithm to generate the shared private (calculated by
 * both parties). This shared private is used as the Blowfish key for the
 * encryption of the packets described in the next section. At this point the
 * client is in an encrypted state. New packets send by the client are in the
 * format described in the next section.
 *
 * When the server receives the client public it will use this to generate the
 * same shared private value. The same procedure is used to transition into the
 * encrypted state. At this point the server is in an encrypted state. New
 * packets send by the client are in the format described in the next section.
 *
 * Once in the encrypted state it is the responsibility of the client to
 * initiate the communication flow with the first command packet.
 *
 * @section protocol Packet Protocol
 * @image html packetprotocol.png "Diagram of the Packet Protocol"
 *
 * All packets start with two sizes in 32-bit big endian format. These sizes
 * indicate the padded size (size over the wire) used for encryption and the
 * actual size of the decrypted data. These sizes are of the remaining data.
 * Neither accounts for the 8 bytes consumed by the sizes.
 *
 * The next set of data, the compression information, only appears in channel
 * connections. The magic "gzip" and the magic "lv6\0" indicate the compression
 * method and do not change. While the magic mentions "gzip" it's actually a
 * raw zlib stream without the gzip format. The uncompressed and compressed
 * sizes are in 32-bit little endian format. If the uncompressed and compressed
 * sizes are equal, the data following the compression information is assumed
 * to be uncompressed. Please note that if you are compressing a packet you
 * should check the compressed size against the uncompressed size. If they are
 * equal (or the compressed size is greater than the uncompressed size) the
 * compressed data should be thrown away and the original uncompressed data
 * should be used instead.
 *
 * After the decryption and optional decompression stage, the remaining data is
 * interpreted as a sequence of commands. Each command must have two sizes
 * followed by the command code. Each command may have a number of command
 * specific bytes following the command code. The number of command specific
 * bytes is determined by the command size(s). The command sizes are in 16-bit
 * big and little endian format. The command size is equal to the number of
 * command specific bytes plus 4. This could be adding on the size of the
 * command code and one of the sizes or both sizes but not the command code.
 * Either way, it doesn't make much sense. The command code is in 16-bit little
 * endian format and indicates what action should be taken on receipt of the
 * command. The command code will indicate how to interpret the command
 * specific bytes (if they exist for the given command).
 *
 * The encrypted connection will send a @ref libcomp::Message::Packet to the
 * message queue provided by @ref SetMessageQueue for each command parsed. The
 * message object will provide the command code and the packet data will
 * contain only the command specific data for that specific command.
