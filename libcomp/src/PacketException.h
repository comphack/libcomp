/**
 * Exception in reading to or writing from a Packet object. This class is
 * thrown when bugs crop up in packet parsing or writing code. As a general
 * rule of thumb no data being read from a packet should be trusted. Start by
 * writing code to check the size of the packet. If the packet is not a fixed
 * size, check for a minimum size before reading in any values that determine
 * the dynamic size. Dynamic size values should be checked for sane values and
 * that the calculated size of the packet is exactly the size of the packet.
 * While a larger packet won't throw an exception, the code should not allow
 * for extra data tacked on to the end of a packet. When writing packets, be
 * aware of the maximum packet size (@ref MAX_PACKET_SIZE). This is especially
 * true when sending large packets like files to the console or a large number
 * of action reports from mob kills.
 *
 * Aside from sanity checking dynamic packet sizes, you should still sanity
 * check all values in the packet. For example, if you receive a movement
 * packet you should check the origin position is the last known location of
 * the character and the destination is valid. The path between these two
 * points should be checked for collisions. No time value for a movement packet
 * should exceed 1/2 second and the distance should be calculated and used to
 * determine the speed of the movement. This speed should be within the
 * allowable range of the character or object being moved. The client should
 * only be able to move their character or active demon (if one is summoned).
 * Thus, the object UID should be compared to these two UID values. Keeping
 * this in mind while parsing packets should help prevent packet exceptions and
 * bugs in your code.
 *
 * Like all exceptions, a packet exception will contain the backtrace as well
 * as the file and line the exception was generated from. A copy of the packet
 * is included in the exception to determine what went wrong in parsing or
 * generation. The position in the packet will be retained for this purpose.
 * To see the current state of the packet use the @ref packet method or
 * output it to the log using @ref log.
